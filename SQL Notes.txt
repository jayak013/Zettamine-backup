JOINS;

Self Join:The fields that are matched based on a join condition the retreival of rows will be done.(Joining itself is self join).

Cross Join:

Inner Join : The fields that are matched based on a join condition the retreival of rows will be done.(self join,equi-join(if '=' is present) and non-equi-join)

Left Outer Join:The fields that are matched based on a join condition the retreival of rows will be done + And also the unmatched rows from left table will be given as a final RS.

Right Outer Join:The fields that are matched based on a join condition the retreival of rows will be done + And also the unmatched rows from right table will be given as a final RS.

Full Outer Join:The fields that are matched based on a join condition the retreival of rows will be done + And also the unmatched rows from left and right table will be given as a final RS.


Set Operators;(considering 2 RS)
1. Union: duplicated rows are made as a single record along with them, all remaining rows from both the RS will be put in the final RS.
2. Union All: Both the RS's rows combined and made as a final resultset.
3. Intersect: Only matched rows from both the RS will be made as final RS.
4. Minus Or Except: Unmathed rows in the second result set will be made as a final RS.
