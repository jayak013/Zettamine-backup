****GIT PULL VS GIT FETCH
1. GIT PULL command will get latest changes from central repository to local repository(file transferring will happen here)
2. GIT FETCH command will tell your local git to retrieve the latest meta-data information from the original(yes does not do any file transferring. It's more like just checking to see if there are any changes available

git fetch + git merge = git pull
